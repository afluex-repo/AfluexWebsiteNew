                <h3>Why Choose Our eCommerce Web Design Services?</h3>
                <p class="gb-headline"></p>
                <p>It is estimated that 53 percent of website visits would be abandoned if the website takes more than three seconds to load. In comparison, almost 50 percent of people expect that the website would load in less than two seconds. If your E-Commerce website's efficiency is lacking, your competitor's website would be where your audience escapes. Afluex Multiservices LLP is the top E-Commerce Web Design Company in Lucknow.</p>
                <p>The speed of the eCommerce website influences more than just user experience. It also plays an important part in search engine optimization. In comparison, fast loaded E-Commerce websites tend to have better conversion rates and lower bounce rates. Your store's search rankings will drop if search engines determine your website is loading more slowly than expected. When we build an E-Commerce website, we take the search engine optimization, user experience & page speed seriously for both smartphone and desktop shopping experience.</p>
