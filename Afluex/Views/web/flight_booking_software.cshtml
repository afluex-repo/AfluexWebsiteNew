                    To engage and represent global customers, travel agencies and individual agents are turning to top travel technology tools and mobile apps. They no longer use the conventional offline method for booking travel offers. With the advent of top travel technologies and mobility solutions, agencies are using online flight booking tools, which allows end customers and sub agencies to search for and reserve flight deals online. As a result, the majority of travel start-ups, both non-IATA and IATA, are opting for the OTA model.
